      <h2>Collaborative Discussion Forum Summaries - Unit 1-3 & 8-10</h2>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>We examined the revolutionary possibilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the strict GDPR and ICO data protection laws in our collaborative discussion sessions. These talks brought to light the ways that IoT is affecting different industries as well as how crucial data protection is.</p>

<p>By improving operations and decision-making through device connectivity and real-time data analysis, the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to completely transform industries including smart cities and healthcare (Sundmaeker et al., 2010). However, obstacles including unclear protocols, problems integrating data, and the requirement for sophisticated big data infrastructures impede the adoption of IoT (Weber, 2010). Due to serious security and privacy issues, strong measures like encryption and frequent software upgrades are required (Panagiotis Mourtzas, 2023). While the ICO concentrates on encryption and ongoing inspections to maintain data privacy, the GDPR mandates suitable protections based on threats to people' rights (Voigt & von dem Bussche, 2017). The flexibility of the ICO in complying with regulations and the UK's independent data agreements following Brexit were also deliberated (Bradford, 2020; Edwards, 2018).<p>

<h2>Outcomes from Team Exercises</h2>

<p>Through exercises, our team developed solutions for processing datasets and solving complex problems in various environments, honing the skills necessary to be productive team members in a virtual professional environment. We critically analysed data wrangling problems and applied appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques.</p>

<h2>Team Exercise 1: Database Design for ABC Electronics - Unit 6</h2>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>For ABC Electronics, we created a logical database in the first exercise to improve data management and expedite procedures. The project required selecting an appropriate database management system (DBMS), putting in place a data management pipeline, and defining entities, characteristics, relationships, data types, and formats.</p>

<h2>Team Meeting Notes:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Initial Phase:</strong> Discussion about entity identification, database structure, and project scope. low level of early member involvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-Phase:</strong> Assignment of duties, beginning data integration, and preliminary design work. stressing the need of continuing contact.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Phase:</strong> Members' some contributions, particularly those from Robert and Funmilayo. completion of the report authoring, data cleansing, and database design.</li>

<h4>Critical Analysis:</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Essential to eliminate duplicated and incomplete records, forming the foundation for further normalization.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Entity Identification:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Crucial for structuring the database around logical entities, a core principle of database normalization.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <ul>
            <li>Vital for efficient querying and updates, reducing data anomalies and redundancy.</li>

           <h3>API Security Requirements</h3>
      <p>I evaluated the security requirements of an API of our choice and wrote a brief security requirements specification to mitigate risks associated with the API for enabling data sharing, scraping, and connectivity. The report detailing this task is available in the following link:</p>

      <h1>Unit 11</h1>

      
    <h2> DBMS Transaction and Recovery</h2>


<p>In Unit 11, "DBMS Transaction and Recovery," we explored how database systems handle failures and ensure data integrity through transaction processing. The unit focused on achieving a consistent database state, where transactions are fully committed or not committed at all, preventing errors within the database.</p>
