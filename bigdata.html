 <h3>DreamHome Property Management Case Study</h3>
      <p>An overview of an example relational database, the DreamHome Property Management Case Study, is used to illustrate how to establish a database project. The case study illustrates how fact-finding techniques can be used and the documentation produced in the early stages of the database system development lifecycle, namely the database planning, system definition, and requirements collection and analysis stages.


      Consider the following requirements:

</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Study Chapter 10 to understand the overall concepts of a business information system, and the database development lifecycle (see figure 10.1). Consider the importance of database design and how the process can be decomposed into three phases: conceptual, logical, and physical database design. Note how the design of the application (the functional approach) affects database design (the data approach).</li>
          <li>A database project involves stakeholders from within an organisation as well as external stakeholders, and some may be technical while others are business oriented. A business value must be realised from an investment in the information system. Hence all stakeholders – particularly senior management – must be aware and convinced of the requirements and outcomes of the project. Database development must use fact-finding techniques to capture requirements and details from relevant stakeholders. Study chapter 11 to understand the most commonly used fact-finding techniques and identify the advantages and disadvantages of each (see sections 11.1-3).</li>
          <li>Details of the example DreamHome database are included in Appendix A. DreamHome is a fictitious property management company with branch offices in cities throughout the United Kingdom, each with allocated members of staff and a manager. Note the data and transactions requirement provided from a branch user view and from a staff user view.</li>
          <li>A worked example on using fact-finding techniques for the design of the DreamHome database is explained in section 11.4. Note the overview of the current system, and how the planning phase has contributions from the developer, director, manager, supervisor, and assistant. The system definition is then followed by requirement capturing involving the same stakeholders as well as the client. Note resulting documentation from these various stages.</li>

           <h3>Building a DBMS</h3>
      <p>Most Python codes and datasets are provided in files included in the Kazil textbook’s repository (see Unit 2 and 4 Reading). The main aim here is therefore not learning the Python programming language, but rather learning how Python may be used in data analysis.

Complete an example with storing data in a relational database. The example uses SQLite and includes the following parts:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Installing SQLite and setting a relational database with Python: See the section Setting Up Your Local Database with Python on pages 145-146 of the Kazil textbook. You are also able to use the SQL workspace in Codio.</li>
          <li>Saving the cleaned UNICEF dataset into the SQLite database: See pages 193-194 and refer to Unit 4 if necessary.</li>

          <ul>
      <h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
      
        <ul>
        <li>Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques (involving preparing, cleaning, exploring, creating, optimising and evaluating big data) to solve them.</li>

    <h3> DBMS Transaction and Recovery</h3>

      <h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
      
        <ul>
        <li>Introduce transaction processing.</li>
        <li>Identify the ACID transaction state and their effects on the transaction cycle.</li>
        <li>Examine scheduled transactions, system failures and checkpoints.</li>
 
        <ul>
          
        

           <h3>Back Up Procedure</h3>
      <p>In 100 - 150 words, critically evaluate the disaster recovery system called the “Grandfather-Father-Son" GFS backup procedure. Using the sites listed in this week’s reading list as an introduction to the topic, highlight how the strategy makes the back-up of large databases less resource heavy and argue whether this strategy is effective when compared to other methods of backing up data.

           <h3>Content Challenge</h3>
      <p>This module has extensively covered data wrangling processes. This last seminar will provide a discursive overview of the module to help with your final reflection and e-portfolio development. Review the content of this week's Lecturecast (Reflective Research Activities) and the questions below. You can carry out the review as a team or on your own:
