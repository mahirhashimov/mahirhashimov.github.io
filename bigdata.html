      <h2>Collaborative Discussion Forum Summaries - Unit 1-3 & 8-10</h2>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>We examined the revolutionary possibilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the strict GDPR and ICO data protection laws in our collaborative discussion sessions. These talks brought to light the ways that IoT is affecting different industries as well as how crucial data protection is.</p>

<p>By improving operations and decision-making through device connectivity and real-time data analysis, the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to completely transform industries including smart cities and healthcare (Sundmaeker et al., 2010). However, obstacles including unclear protocols, problems integrating data, and the requirement for sophisticated big data infrastructures impede the adoption of IoT (Weber, 2010). Due to serious security and privacy issues, strong measures like encryption and frequent software upgrades are required (Panagiotis Mourtzas, 2023). While the ICO concentrates on encryption and ongoing inspections to maintain data privacy, the GDPR mandates suitable protections based on threats to people' rights (Voigt & von dem Bussche, 2017). The flexibility of the ICO in complying with regulations and the UK's independent data agreements following Brexit were also deliberated (Bradford, 2020; Edwards, 2018).<p>

<h2>Outcomes from Team Exercises</h2>

<p>Through exercises, our team developed solutions for processing datasets and solving complex problems in various environments, honing the skills necessary to be productive team members in a virtual professional environment. We critically analysed data wrangling problems and applied appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques.</p>

<h2>Team Exercise 1: Database Design for ABC Electronics - Unit 6</h2>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>For ABC Electronics, we created a logical database in the first exercise to improve data management and expedite procedures. The project required selecting an appropriate database management system (DBMS), putting in place a data management pipeline, and defining entities, characteristics, relationships, data types, and formats.</p>

<h2>Team Meeting Notes:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Initial Phase:</strong> Discussion about entity identification, database structure, and project scope. low level of early member involvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-Phase:</strong> Assignment of duties, beginning data integration, and preliminary design work. stressing the need of continuing contact.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Phase:</strong> Members' some contributions, particularly those from Robert and Funmilayo. completion of the report authoring, data cleansing, and database design.</li>

<h3>Task 7: Back Up Procedure - UNIT 11</h3>

<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>To critically evaluate the "Grandfather-Father-Son" (GFS) backup procedure and compare its effectiveness against other data backup methods.</p>

<h4>Critical Evaluation of the GFS Backup Procedure:</h4>
<p>A hierarchical technique that strikes a compromise between resource efficiency and dependable data recovery is the Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS) backup plan. By grouping backups into cycles that are daily for the son, weekly for the father, and monthly for the grandpa, it lessens the requirement for ongoing complete backups while guaranteeing numerous recovery points. Large databases benefit from this technique since it keeps a reasonable amount of backups over time.<p>

<p>There are several obstacles involved with data wrangling, including managing problems with data quality, resource-intensive procedures, scalability constraints, and technological complexity. It does, however, also present significant chances to improve data security, efficiency, and quality. Organisations may overcome these constraints and optimise their data wrangling processes to promote accurate and efficient data analysis by utilising cutting-edge technologies, techniques, and security measures. Effective data management and analysis require striking a balance between fixing the constraints and seizing the possibilities.<p>

With the integration of cutting-edge technology and the resolution of scalability and compliance issues, ABC Electronics' final database system is poised for future expansion and innovation. The project demonstrated how crucial careful planning, stakeholder involvement, and ongoing development are to achieving a reliable and expandable data management system.<p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Scalability Enhancement:</strong> Implement partitioning and indexing; consider PostgreSQL or cloud-based solutions for future scalability (Pirozzi, 2018).</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Data Analytics:</strong> Integrate tools like Tableau or Power BI for detailed insights (Pala, 2017; Gonçalves et al., 2023).</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Compliance Audits:</strong> Schedule regular compliance audits for GDPR, PCI DSS adherence (Elluri et al., 2018).</li>
    <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> Conduct training sessions on data entry, security, and reporting (Elnaga & Imran, 2013).</li>
    <li><strong>System Performance Monitoring:</strong> Use tools like Nagios or New Relic for real-time performance monitoring (Cardoso, 2018).</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced User Interface (UI):</strong> Refine UI based on user feedback to improve usability.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Backup and Recovery Plan:</strong> Develop and test a comprehensive data backup and recovery plan (Cerullo & Cerullo, 2004).</li>
</ol>
<p>By prioritizing these recommendations, ABC Electronics can maintain and enhance its database system's effectiveness, scalability, and compliance, ensuring it meets current and future business needs.</p>
